You **NEED** this specific Java version to play!<br>
Adoptium's Java 21 JDK<br>
Get it at https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
<br><br>
Once you've installed the JDK, head to [releases](https://github.com/DogeKeen/Caffeine-Ijueva/releases) and download the zip from the latest release.<br>
After unzipping, run the jar file with OpenJDK and you'll be good to go!

Thanks for playing! :3
